    <h3 id="Joseon" >Joseon Dynasty</h3>
    <p >n 1394, the city of Hanyang (modern-day Seoul) was designated as the capital by King Taejo of Joseon, marking the beginning of its pivotal role in Korean history. Throughout the Joseon era, Seoul became a major center of political, economic, and cultural growth. Many palaces and traditional buildings constructed during this period, such as Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung, remain key attractions in Seoul today. These sites are significant for their architectural styles and royal heritage, showcasing the cultural richness of the era.</p>

    <h3 id="Modern">Modernization and Japanese Occupation</h3>
    <p>Toward the end of the 19th century, Seoul began its path towards modernization, highlighted by the proclamation of the Korean Empire in 1897, which reinforced its status as a central city. However, during the Japanese occupation from 1910 to 1945, Seoul came under colonial rule, resulting in significant damage to cultural heritage and the replacement of many Korean structures with Japanese-style buildings. This period was marked by darkness not only for Seoul but also for the entire Korean peninsula.</p>

    <h3 id="Contemporary">Contemporary Seoul</h3>
    <p>Following liberation in 1945, Seoul was restored as the capital of South Korea. The city underwent rapid industrialization and urbanization starting in the 1960s. Hosting the 1988 Seoul Olympics played a crucial role in introducing South Korea to the world stage, and since then, Seoul has emerged as a global city. Recently, fueled by advancements in digital technology and the worldwide popularity of K-culture, Seoul has established itself as a leading center of culture and economy on the international stage.</p>
